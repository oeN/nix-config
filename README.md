# oeN's Nix Config

This is my nix-config repository

I take inspiration, or blatantly copying from https://github.com/ryan4yin/nix-config/tree/main

For now it handles only my macOS system, but I'll add other NixOS machines and server in the future

## Disclaimer

This README is for me and future me, so I'll point out some obvious fact about the code in order to remember it and do not make a tons of changes in the future because I think is better in a different way or I forgot why that file or that function was placed there.
